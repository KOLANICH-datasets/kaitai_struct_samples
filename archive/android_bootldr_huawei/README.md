## bootloader-angler-shortened.img

Same partition names as in [bootloader-angler-angler-01.31.img](https://androidfilehost.com/?fid=24407100847292744), but the large payloads are replaced with a short explanation of each partition so that the resulting file is just as useful for testing, but

* much smaller in size (~~3.44 MiB~~ &xrarr; **1.55 KiB**) and
* contains no copyrightable data (the original file includes proprietary executables and other resources).

Source: own work

Python script for generating: [./bootloader-angler-shortened.py](./bootloader-angler-shortened.py)
